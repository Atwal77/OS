-> what is a process?
		->A process is a program in execution. Process is not as same as program code but a lot more than it. A process is an 'active' entity as opposed to program which is considered to be a 		  'passive' entity. Attributes held by process include hardware state, memory, CPU etc.
		  Process are of two types:->
						Operating system processes.eg:->firewall management,display management;
						User processes.eg:-> browser or any other user run programs;

->state of a process:->

		Processes in the operating system can be in any of the following states:

			NEW- The process is being created.
			READY- The process is waiting to be assigned to a processor.
			RUNNING- Instructions are being executed.
			WAITING- The process is waiting for some event to occur(such as an I/O completion or reception of a signal).
			TERMINATED- The process has finished execution.

->Difference between Program and Process:->

->what are the reasons for process suspension?

	->swaping->Suspend ready – Process that was initially in the ready state but were swapped out of main memory(refer Virtual Memory topic) and placed onto external storage by scheduler are said to 			   be in suspend ready state. The process will transition back to ready state whenever the process is again brought onto the main memory.
	->interactive user request->on the request of user like user intially started one process but then after that moved to some other process so the intial process is suspended;
	->timing
	->parent process request


->what is a thread?
	->A thread is like small subpart of a process.It is also called as a lightweight process.Its a basic unit of CPU utilization because as more threads increases cpu shift increases hence cpu 		  utilization becomes more.it comprises of :->thread_id,program counter(which store the address of next intruction to be executed),register set,stack space;
	  Why Multithreading?
	  A thread is also known as lightweight process. The idea is to achieve parallelism by dividing a process into multiple threads. For example, in a browser, multiple tabs can be different threads. 		  MS Word uses multiple threads: one thread to format the text, another thread to process inputs, etc.


->Process vs Thread?
The primary difference is that threads within the same process run in a shared memory space, while processes run in separate memory spaces.
Threads are not independent of one another like processes are, and as a result threads share with other threads their code section, data section, and OS resources (like open files and signals). But, like process, a thread has its own program counter (PC), register set, and stack space.
Advantages of Thread over Process
1. Responsiveness: If the process is divided into multiple threads, if one thread completes its execution, then its output can be immediately returned.

2. Faster context switch: Context switch time between threads is lower compared to process context switch. Process context switching requires more overhead from the CPU.

3. Effective utilization of multiprocessor system: If we have multiple threads in a single process, then we can schedule multiple threads on multiple processor. This will make process execution faster.

4. Resource sharing: Resources like code, data, and files can be shared among all threads within a process.
Note: stack and registers can’t be shared among the threads. Each thread has its own stack and registers.

5. Communication: Communication between multiple threads is easier, as the threads shares common address space. while in process we have to follow some specific communication technique for communication between two process.
